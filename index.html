    <div class="about" id="about">
      <h2>About the Firm</h2>
      <p>
    Elite Wealth Investment is a Swiss independent trading and investment services firm focused on disciplined execution,
        structured risk management, and long-term capital stewardship. The firm operates with an emphasis on transparency,
        regulatory alignment, and professional standards consistent with established European financial practices.
<p>
Rather than positioning itself as a mass-market trading platform, Elite Wealth Investment works with clients who value clarity,
process, and a measured approach to market participation. Investment decisions are guided by market structure, data analysis,
  and defined risk parameters, not speculation or short-term narratives.

  <p>
  <h2>Account Structure and Advisory Scope</h2>
   </p> 
Elite Wealth Investment operates under clearly defined account structures.
       <p>
For clients who elect to operate under a managed account mandate, all services related to execution, monitoring, and 
         risk oversight are included. Portfolio activity, exposure adjustments, and protective measures are handled within 
         an agreed framework, allowing for coordinated management aligned with the client’s objectives and risk tolerance.
         <p>
       For clients who do not operate a managed account, the firm’s role is intentionally limited. In such cases, Elite Wealth
           Investment does not promote constant or excessive trading activity. Instead, its focus is on helping clients
           understand portfolio positioning, margin usage, risk levels, and potential outcomes under different market conditions. Guidance is provided to support informed decision-making rather than transactional volume.
       <p>
         This distinction ensures transparency regarding responsibilities, expectations, and the appropriate level of involvement for each account type.
